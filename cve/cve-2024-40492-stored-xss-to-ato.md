# CVE-2024-40492: Stored XSS to ATO

## Description

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious scripts into a web application, and those scripts are stored on the server. When other users access the data containing the malicious script, the script is executed in their browsers.

## Step to reproduce

1. Go to [https://app.heartbeat.chat/](https://app.heartbeat.chat/)\

2. Create an account with name:

> &#x20;First name is payload&#x20;
>
> **`giongfnef"><h1>test</h1>"><img src=1 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`**
>
> Lastet name is&#x20;
>
> **`giongfnef"><img src=1 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`**

3. Go to "Threads" then search for that first name like giongfnef -> XSS is triager -> this is stored XSS which can lead to Account Take Over

## #POC

## Impact

After triggering the XSS, I can proceed with an Account Take Over. Since this is a stored XSS, any user who views the user section or searches for the user `giongfnef` will trigger the XSS and have their session stolen.

## Mitigation

To prevent stored XSS vulnerabilities, follow these best practices:

* **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server-side.
* **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it in the browser to prevent execution of injected scripts.
* **Use Security Libraries:** Use libraries and frameworks that automatically handle input sanitization and output encoding.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

Thanks for reading, have a nice day :heart:
